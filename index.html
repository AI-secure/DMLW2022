<p>This workshop focuses on how future researchers and practitioners should prepare themselves for achieving security and privacy in machine learning through decentralization and blockchain techniques, as well as how to leverage machine learning techniques to automate some processes in current decentralized systems and ownership economies in web3. We attempt to share recent related work from different communities, discuss the foundations of trustworthiness problems in machine learning and potential solutions, toolings, platforms via decentralization, blockchain and web3, and chart out important directions for future work and cross-community collaborations.</p>

<!--<p>To address these negative societal impacts of ML, researchers have looked into different principles and constraints to ensure trustworthy and socially responsible machine learning systems. This workshop makes the first attempt towards bridging the gap between security, privacy, fairness, ethics, game theory, and machine learning communities and aims to discuss the principles and experiences of developing trustworthy and socially responsible machine learning systems. The workshop also focuses on how future researchers and practitioners should prepare themselves for reducing the risks of unintended behaviors of sophisticated ML models.</p>-->

<!--<p>This workshop aims to bring together researchers interested in the emerging and interdisciplinary field of trustworthy and socially responsible machine learning from a broad range of disciplines with different perspectives to this problem. We attempt to highlight recent related work from different communities, clarify the foundations of trustworthy machine learning, and chart out important directions for future work and cross-community collaborations. Topics of this workshop include but are not limited to:</p>-->

<!--<ul>-->
<!--<li>Novel methods for building more trustworthy machine learning models that prevent or alleviate negative societal impacts of existing ML methods</li>-->
<!--<li>New applications and settings where trustworthiness of machine learning plays an important role and how well existing techniques work under these settings</li>-->
<!--<li>Machine learning models with verifiable guarantees (such as robustness, fairness and privacy guarantees) to build trustworthiness</li>-->
<!--<li>Privacy-preserving machine learning approaches</li>-->
<!--<li>Theoretical understanding of trustworthy machine learning</li>-->
<!--<li>Explainable and interpretable AI</li>-->
<!--<li>Robust decision making under uncertainty</li>-->
<!--<li>Futuristic concerns about trustworthy machine learning</li>-->
<!--<li>Game-theoretic analysis for socially responsible machine learning systems</li>-->
<!--<li>Case studies and field research of the societal impacts of applying machine learning in mission-critical and human-centric tasks</li>-->
<!--</ul>-->

<!--<p><b>Points of difference</b>: This workshop aims to raise awareness of the societal issues involved in applying machine learning to real-world systems, and stimulate interdisciplinary research that can tackle open challenges on building trustworthy and socially responsible machine learning models. Although some of our topics may overlap with other workshops (e.g., attacks on ML are discussed in workshops on adversarial robustness), these workshops do not have a central theme on the social responsibility of machine learning and do not aim to directly address societal issues of ML. </p>-->

<!--<h4>Diversity Statement</h4>-->
<!--We have taken various steps to expand the diversity of the participants. The organizers and invited speakers have diverse backgrounds (e.g., gender, race, affiliations, seniority, and nationality). In particular, many are from underrepresented groups in STEM fields: the organizers include female scholars and the confirmed speakers include female scholars as well as researchers from underrepresented races. The organizers include both experienced and senior members as well as junior researchers, including people who have not organized this workshop series. Moreover, The workshop encompasses researchers from both industry and academia. Additionally, the workshop is inclusive and covers a wide range of topics (e.g., fairness, transparency, interpretability, privacy, robustness, etc.), which has raised a lot of attention now. We also aim to bring together both theoretical and applied researchers from various domains.-->
